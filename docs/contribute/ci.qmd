Continuous integration is about commits being merged frequently and automatically. When a new commit is made, a series of tests will be done to make sure that this commit is error-free, appliance format, robust in difference environment and safe to be merged. This process drive each new development through building, testing, quality checking, it is like a pipeline.

This page contains an extensive explanation on how the Ribasim pipeline works.

# Github actions
When a new development is to be merged into the main branch, one can either make a pull request or commit to main branch directly. Before a commit is added to main branch, a series of GitHub action will be performed. Github actions includes following checks:

* Julia Run Testmodels: This is to make sure all the test models can be run successfully
* Julia Tests: Run Julia unit tests on multiple platforms, depends on generated testmodels
* Docs: Executes our documentation examples
* Pre-commit: Checks code quality with linters, adjust the format
* Python codegen: Check that code generation wouldn't change any files
* Python lint (Run mypy on our Python codebase) TODO: Rename "Python Lint" to "Mypy" and "python_lint.yml" to "mypy.yml"
* Ribasim Python tests (Run Ribasim Python tests on multiple platforms and multiple Python versions, depends on ribasim_testmodels)
* QGIS Tests (Run QGIS tests, very limited at the moment)

# TeamCity
Ribasim has another cloud-based CI/CD pipeline that is in the TeamCity. But TeamCity is not always triggered. TeamCity is only used in the following circumustance:
