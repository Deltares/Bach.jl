Ribasim welcomes contributions.

There is developer documentation for the [Julia core](core.qmd), [Python tooling](python.qmd), and the [QGIS plugin](qgis.qmd).
A guide on how to add a new node type to both is written in [adding node types](addnode.qmd).
[Release process](release.qmd) describes the steps to follow when creating a new Ribasim release.
