    "# Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to Ribasim!\n",
    "This guide will help you get started with the basics of installing and using Ribasim for river basin simulation.\n",
    "In this guide, the schematization of models will be implemented in Python using the Ribasim Python package.\n",
    "The Ribasim package (named `ribasim`) simplifies the process of building, updating, and analyzing Ribasim model programmatically.\n",
    "It also allows for the creation of entire models from base data, ensuring that your model setup is fully reproducible.\n",
    "This package is available on PyPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "In this guide, we will focus on a fictional river basin called Crystal, which will serve as our case study.\n",
    "The guide is divided into different modules, each covering various scenarios.\n",
    "These include simulating natural flow, implementing reservoirs, and observing the impact of other structures.\n",
    "While not all node types and possibilities will be demonstrated, the focus will be on the most commonly used and significant situations.\n",
    "By the end of the guide, users will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Set Up a Basic Ribasim Model**: Understand how to create a new model for a river basin using the Ribasim Python package.\n",
    "- **Evaluate the Impact of Demands**: Introduce water demand (such as irrigation) and assess their effects on the river basin.\n",
    "- **Modify and Update Models**: Learn how to update existing models with new data and changes.\n",
    "- **Analyze Simulation Results**: Use built-in tools to analyze and interpret the results of your simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Starting RIBASIM\n",
    "\n",
    "## System requirements\n",
    "Before installing Ribasim, ensure your system meets the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operating System: Windows 10 or later, or Linux (latest distributions)\n",
    "- Processor: x86-64 (64-bit)\n",
    "- RAM: 4 GB minimum, 8 GB recommended\n",
    "- Hard Drive: 1GB of free space\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "1. Download Ribasim: Obtain the Ribasim 9 installation package from the official website: [Ribasim - Installation](https://ribasim.org/install.html) under chapter '2 Download':\n",
    "\n",
    "* For Windows download: `ribasim_windows.zip`\n",
    "* For Linux: `ribasim_linux.zip`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unpack the `.zip` archive: It is important to keep the contents of the zip file organized within a single directory. The Ribasim executable can be found in the directory;\n",
    "3. Check installation: To check whether the installation was performed successfully, in `cmd` go to the executable path and type `ribasim` with no arguments in the command line. This will give the following message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```batch\n",
    "error: the following required arguments were not provided:\n",
    " <TOML_PATH>\n",
    "Usage: ribasim <TOML_PATH>\n",
    "For more information, try '--help'.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We use a command line interface (CLI) to install our Ribasim package. To install Ribasim open PowerShell or Windows command prompt and write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda install ribasim\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "mamba install ribasim\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data preparation\n",
    "Download the `Crystal_Basin.zip` file from the website. Extract `Crystal_Basin.zip` and place it in the same directory as your Ribasim installation. This folder includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `QuickStartGuide.pdf`\n",
    "- `data`: Contains data inputs such as time series needed for running the case.\n",
    "Additionally, your Python model (`.py`) and the results will also be saved in this folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Module 1 - Crystal River Basin\n",
    "We will examine a straightforward example of the Crystal River Basin, which includes a main river and a single tributary flowing into the sea (see @fig-crystal-basin).\n",
    "An average discharge of $44.45  \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}$ is measured at the confluence.\n",
    "In this module, the basin is free of any activities, allowing the model to simulate the natural flow.\n",
    "The next step is to include a demand (irrigation) that taps from a canal out of the main river.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Crystal Basin based on natural flow](https://s3.deltares.nl/ribasim/doc-image/quickstart/Crystal-Basin-based-on-natural-flow.png){fig-align=\"left\" #fig-crystal-basin}\n",
    "\n",
    "After this module the user will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a river basin model from scratch\n",
    "- Understand the functionality of the  ‘demand’ and ‘basin’ nodes\n",
    "- Generate overview of results\n",
    "- Evaluate the simulation results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module 1.1 - Natural Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Import packages\n",
    "Before building the model we need to import some modules.\n",
    "Open your python platform (Spyder, VS code etc.), created a new file and name it `Crystal_1.1` and save it into your model folder `Crystal_Basin`.\n",
    "Import the following modules in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",

    ")\n",
    "from shapely.geometry import Point\n",
    "import subprocess  # For running the model\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Setup paths and model configuration\n",
    "Reference the paths of the Ribasim installation and model directory and define the time period (2022-01-01 until 2023-01-01) for the model simulation:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "base_dir = Path(\"c:/Ribasim\")\n",
    "model_dir = base_dir / \"Crystal_Basin\"\n",
    "data_path = model_dir / \"data/input/ACTINFLW.csv\"\n",
    "\n",
    "starttime = \"2022-01-01\"\n",
    "endtime = \"2023-01-01\"\n",

    "    starttime=starttime,\n",
    "    endtime=endtime,\n",
    "    crs=\"EPSG:4326\",\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Flow boundary nodes\n",
    "Crystal Basin consists of two inflow points, the tributary and the main Crystal river, we will call them `Minor` and `Main` respectively.\n",
    "In order to define the time series flow rate ($\\text{m}^3/\\text{s}$) we read the discharge data from `ACTINFLW.csv`.\n",
    "This inflow data goes monthly from 2014 to 2023.\n",
    "However, for this exercise actual runtime is already defined in step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = pd.read_csv(data_path, sep=\";\")\n",
    "data['sum']= data['minor']+data['main']\n",
    "# Average and max inflow of the whole summed inflow data timeseries\n",
    "# From 2014 - 2023\n",
    "print('Average inflowQ m3/s:',data['sum'].mean())\n",
    "print('Maximum inflowQ m3/s:',data['sum'].max)\n",
    "\n",
    "model.flow_boundary.add(\n",
    "    Node(1, Point(0.0, 0.0), name='Main'),\n",
    "    [flow_boundary.Time(time=data.time, flow_rate=data.main,\n",
    "    )]\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "model.flow_boundary.add(\n",

    "    )]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Basin node (confluence)\n",
    "To schematize the confluence from the tributary we will use the Basin node.\n",
    "The node by itself portrays as a bucket with a certain volume of water and can be used for different purposes, such as a reservoir, a lake or in this case a confluence.\n",

    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Tabulated rating curve\n",
    "In the previous step we implemented a Basin node that functions as a confluence.\n",
    "Conceptually, the basin acts like a bucket of water, accumulating inflows and then releasing them.\n",
    "However, the model does not run if the basin is directly connected to the terminal node.\n",
    "This is because, for the model to function properly, we need to define a relation between the water level ($h$) in the basin and the outflow ($Q$) from the basin.\n",
    "This relation is defined by the `Tabulated Rating Curve` and thus serves as a critical component.\n",
    "This setup mimics the behavior of a gate or spillway, allowing us to model how varying water levels influence flow rates at the confluence.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the two inflows come together at the confluence, we expect, as mentioned and coded before, a discharge average of $44.45 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}$.\n",
    "It is therefore expected that the confluence basin reaches a level where the outflow is equal to the inflow via the rating curve.\n",
    "Only then is the confluence basin in equilibrium.\n",
    "To ensure that inflow equals outflow (IN=OUT) and keeping in mind the maximum depth of the river is $6 \\text{ m}$, the $Q(h)$ relationship in @tbl-input2 will be used as input.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Ribasim, the $Q(h)$ relation is a linear function, so the points in between will be linearly interpolated.\n",
    "@fig-discharge illustrates the visual process and shows a progressive increase in discharge with rising water levels.\n",
    "In this case this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At level $0.0$: No discharge occurs. This represents a condition where the water level is too low for any flow to be discharged.\n",
    "- At level $2.0$: Discharge is max. $50.0 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}$. This is a bit above the average discharge rate, corresponding to the water level where normal flow conditions are established.\n",
    "- At level $5.0$: Discharge rate reaches $200.0 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}$. This discharge rate occurs at the water level during wet periods, indicating higher flow capacity.\n",

    "Finally all the water will discharge into the ocean.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Defining edges\n",
    "Implement the connections (edges) between the nodes, in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flow boundaries to the basin;\n",
    "2. Basin to the rating curve;\n",
    "3. Tabulated rating curve to the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
