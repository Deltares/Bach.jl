# Introduction
Welcome to Ribasim!
This guide will help you get started with the basics of installing and using Ribasim for river basin simulation.
For this guide, the user interface will be implemented in Python using the Ribasim Python package.
The Ribasim package (name 'ribasim') simplifies the process of building, updating, and analyzing Ribasim model programmatically.
It also allows for the creation of entire models from base data, ensuring that your model setup is fully reproducible.
This package is available on PyPI.
## Learning objectives
In this guide, we will focus on a fictional river basin called Crystal, which will serve as our case study.
The guide is divided into different modules, each covering various scenarios.
These include simulating natural flow, implementing reservoirs, and observing the impact of other structures.
While not all node types and possibilities will be demonstrated, the focus will be on the most commonly used and significant situations.
By the end of the guide, users will be able to:
- **Set Up a Basic Ribasim Model**: Understand how to create a new model for a river basin using the Ribasim Python package.
- **Evaluate the Impact of Demands**: Introduce water demand (such as irrigation) and assess their effects on the river basin.
- **Modify and Update Models**: Learn how to update existing models with new data and changes.
- **Analyze Simulation Results**: Use built-in tools to analyze and interpret the results of your simulations.

# Starting RIBASIM
## System requirements
Before installing Ribasim, ensure your system meets the following requirements:
- Operating System: Windows 10 or later, or Linux (latest distributions)
- Processor: x86-64 (64-bit)
- RAM: 4 GB minimum, 8 GB recommended
- Hard Drive: 1GB of free space

## Installation
1. Download Ribasim: Obtain the Ribasim 9 installation package from the official website: [Ribasim - Installation](deltares.github.io) under chapter '2 Download':
* For Windows download: ‘ribasim_windows.zip’
* For Linux: ‘ribasim_linux.zip’
2. Unpack the .zip archive: It is important to keep the contents of the zip file organized within a single directory. The Ribasim executable can be found in the directory;
3. Check installation: To check whether the installation was performed successfully, in cmd go to the executable path and type ribasim with no arguments in the command line. This will give the following message:

```batch
error: the following required arguments were not provided:
 <TOML_PATH>
Usage: ribasim <TOML_PATH>
For more information, try '--help'.
```

4. We use a command line interface (CLI) to install our Ribasim packages. To install Ribasim open PowerShell or Windows command prompt and write:

```batch
conda install Ribasim
```
or

```batch
mamba install Ribasim
```
## Data preparation
Download the Crystal_Basin.zip file from the website. Extract Crystal_Basin.zip and place it in the same directory as your Ribasim installation. This folder includes:
- QuickStartGuide.pdf
- data: Contains data inputs such as time series needed for running the case.
Additionally, your Python model (.py) and eventually the output files will also be saved in this folder.

# Modual 1 - Crystal River Basin

# Modual 2 - Reservoirs and Public Water Supply
