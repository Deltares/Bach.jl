title: "Julia core"
---

With the term "core", we mean the computational engine of Ribasim. As detailed in the
[usage](usage.qmd) documentation, it is generally used as a command line tool.

A quick overview of the model concept is available at the [home page](../index.qmd#sec-concept), while a more in depth discussion is available on the [model concept](modelconcept.qmd) page.
The theory is described on the [equations](equations.qmd) page, and more in-depth numerical considerations are described on the [numerical considerations](numerics.qmd) page. As allocation is a large and self-contained part of the Ribasim core, it is described on the separate [allocation](allocation.qmd) page. Input validation is described on the [validation](validation.qmd) page.

The core is implemented in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/), and
can be found in the [Ribasim repository](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim) under the
`core/` folder. For developers we also advise to read the
[developer documentation](../contribute/core.qmd). Information on coupling can be found [here](coupling.qmd).

An overview of all components is given on the [home page](../index.qmd#sec-components)

# The simulation loop {#sec-simulationloop}

The computational process can be divided in three phases:

- Model initialization
- Running the simulation loop
- Writing the output files

The figure below gives a more detailed description of the simulation loop in the form of a [sequence diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram). From top to bottom, it contains the following blocks:

- Allocation optimization; activated when the allocation timestep has been passed;
- Control actions; activated when some discrete control callback is triggered;
- Water balance; computing the flows over flow edges happens each timestep;
- Time integration step; done by the integrator from `OrdinaryDiffEq.jl`.

# Nested allocation {#sec-nested-allocation}

Since water systems may be extensive, like in the Netherlands, Ribasim models may become large networks with over ten thousand nodes.
To keep a proper functioning allocation concept under these circumstances, the modeller can decompose the network domain into a main network and multiple sub-networks.
The allocation will then be conducted in three steps:

1. conduct an inventory of demands from the sub-networks to inlets from the main network,
2. allocate the available water in the main network to the subnetworks inlets,
3. allocate the assigned water within each subnetwork to the individual demand nodes.

The demand nodes then will request this updated demand from the rule-based simulation.
Whether this updated demand is indeed abstracted depends on all dry-fall control mechanism implemented in the rule-based simulation.

The following sequence diagram illustrates this calculation process within then allocation phase.

```{mermaid}

participant boundary
participant basin
participant user_demand
participant allocation_subNetwork
participant allocation_mainNetwork

user_demand->>allocation_subNetwork: demand
loop
   allocation_subNetwork-->>allocation_mainNetwork: demand inventory at inlets
end
user_demand->>allocation_mainNetwork: demand
boundary->>allocation_mainNetwork: source availability
basin->>allocation_mainNetwork: source availability
allocation_mainNetwork-->>allocation_mainNetwork: allocate to inlets (and user_demands)
allocation_mainNetwork->>user_demand: allocated
allocation_mainNetwork->>allocation_subNetwork: allocated
loop
   allocation_subNetwork-->>allocation_subNetwork: allocate to user_demands
end
allocation_subNetwork->>user_demand: allocated
user_demand->>basin: abstracted
```
