Ribasim currently simulates the following "natural" water balance terms:

1. Precipitation
2. Evaporation
3. Infiltration
4. Drainage
5. Urban runoff
6. Upstream and downstream flow

Additionally, Ribasim simulates the following "allocated" water balance terms:

1. General user
2. Flushing

Depending on the type of boundary conditions, Ribasim requires relation between
storage volume and wetted area $A$, and between the storage volume and the
water level $h$. These are (currently) represented by piecewise linear
relationships.

# Formal model description
In this section we give a formal description of the problem that is solved by Ribasim.
The problem is of the form

$$
\frac{\text{d}\mathbf{u}}{\text{d}t} = f(\mathbf{u},p(t),t),\quad t \in [t_0,t_\text{end}],
$$ {#eq-system}

i.e. a system of coupled first order ordinary differential equations, with initial condition $\mathbf{u}(t_0)= \mathbf{u}_0$ and time dependent input data denoted by $p(t)$.

The model is given by a directed graph, consisting of a set of nodes (or vertices) $V$ and edges $E$.
Let $V$ be the set of node IDs and let $E$ be the set of ordered tuples $(i,j)$ meaning that node $i$ is connected to node $j$.

We can split the set of nodes into two subsets $V = B \cup N$, where $B$ is the set of basins and $N$ is the set of non-basins.
The basins have an associated storage state and the non-basins dictate how water flows to or from basins.

$\mathbf{u}(t)$ is given by all the states of the model, which are (currently) the storage of the basins and the integral terms of the PID controllers, the latter being explained in [3 PID controller](equations.qmd#sec-PID).

Given a single basin with node ID $i \in B$, the equation that dictates the change of its storage over time is given by

$$
\frac{\text{d}S_i}{\text{d}t} =
\sum_{(i',j') \in E | j' = i} Q_{i',j'} - \sum_{(i',j') \in E | i' = i} Q_{i',j'} + F_i(p,t).
$$

Here $Q_{i,j}$ is the flow along an edge, where the graph direction dictates positive flow.
So the first term denotes flow towards the basin, the second one denotes flow away from the basin, and the third term denotes external forcing.
$F_i(p,t)$ is given by input data, and $Q_{i' ,j'}$ is determined by the type of nodes that connect to that edge.

The various node and forcing types that the model can contain are explained in the section [Natural water balance terms](equations.qmd#natural-water-balance-terms).

::: {.callout-note}
In general a model has more nodes than states, so in the Julia core there is a distinction between node indices and state indices. For simplicity these are treated as equal in the documentation when it comes to basins and their storage.
:::

## The Jacobian

The Jacobian is a $n\times n$ matrix where $n$ is the number of states in the simulation. The computation of the Jacobian for the solver is hardcoded in the Julia core, which is faster and more accurate than using finite difference methods.


The entries of the Jacobian $J$ are given by
$$
J[i,j] = \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial u_i},
$$

hence $J[i,j]$ quantifies how $f_j$, the derivative of state $j$ with respect to time, changes with a change in state $i$. If a node creates dependendies between basin storages (or other states), then this yields contributions to the Jacobian. If $j$ corresponds to a storage state, then

$$
J[i,j] = \sum_{(i',j') \in E | j' = i} \frac{\partial Q_{i',j'}}{\partial u_i} - \sum_{(i',j') \in E | i' = i} \frac{\partial Q_{i',j'}}{\partial u_i},
$$

Most of these terms are always $0$, because a flow over an edge only depends on a small number of states. Therefore the matrix $J$ is very sparse.

For many contributions to the Jacobian the derivative of the level $l(S)$ of a basin with respect to its storage $S$ is required. To get an expression for this, we first look at the storage as a function of the level:

$$
S(l) = \int_{l_0}^l A(\ell)d\ell.
$$

From this we obtain $S'(l) = A(l)$ and thus
$$
\frac{\text{d}l}{\text{d}S} = \frac{1}{A(S)}.
$$

:::{.callout-note}
The presence of division by the basin area means that areas of size zero are not allowed.

# Natural water balance terms
## Precipitation

The precipitation term is given by

$$
    Q_P = P \cdot A(S).
$$ {#eq-precip}

Here $P = P(t)$ is the precipitation rate and $A$ is the wetted area. $A$ is a
function of the storage $S = S(t)$: as the volume of water changes, the area of the free water
surface may change as well, depending on the slopes of the surface waters.

## Evaporation

The evaporation term is given by

$$
    Q_E = E_\text{pot} \cdot A(S) \cdot r.
$$ {#eq-evap}

Here $E_\text{pot} = E_\text{pot}(t)$ is the potential evaporation rate and $A$ is the wetted area. $r$ is the reduction factor which depends on the depth $d$ and is given by
$$
    r = \frac{\min\{d,0.1\}}{0.1} \le 1.
$$ {#eq-reduc}
It provides a smooth gradient as $S \rightarrow 0$ (but not at $d=0.1$).

A straightforward formulation $Q_E = \mathrm{max}(E_\text{pot} A(S),
0)$ is unsuitable, as $\frac{\mathrm{d}Q_E}{\mathrm{d}S}(S=0)$ is then not well-defined.

<!--
A hyperbolic tangent is a commonly used activation function
[@enwiki:1106669904] to approximate on-off behavior while preserving a smooth
derivative.
-->

A non-smooth derivative results in extremely small timesteps and long
computation time: ModelingToolkit identifies the singular behavior and adjusts
its timestepping. In a physical interpretation, evaporation is switched on or
off per individual droplet of water. In general, the effect of the reduction term
is negligible, or not even necessary. As a surface water dries, its wetted area
decreases and so does the evaporative flux. However, for (simplified) cases with
constant wetted surface (a rectangular profile), evaporation only stops at $S =
0$.

## Infiltration and Drainage

Infiltration is provided as a lump sum for the basin. If Ribasim is coupled with
MODFLOW 6, the infiltration is computed as the sum of all **positive** flows of the
MODFLOW 6 boundary conditions in the basin:

$$
    Q_\text{inf} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \max(Q_{\mathrm{mf6}_{i,j}}, 0.0)
$$ {#eq-inf}.

Where $i$ is the index of the boundary condition, $j$ the MODFLOW 6 cell index,
$n$ the number of boundary conditions, and $m$ the number of MODFLOW 6 cells in
the basin. $Q_{\mathrm{mf6}_{i,j}}$ is the flow computed by MODFLOW 6 for cell $j$
for boundary condition $i$.

Drainage is a lump sump for the basin, and consists of the sum of the absolute
value of all **negative** flows of the MODFLOW 6 boundary conditions in the
basin.

$$
    Q_\text{drn} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \left| \min(Q_{\mathrm{mf6}_{i,j}}, 0.0) \right|
$$ {#eq-drn}

The interaction with MODFLOW 6 boundary conditions is explained in greater
detail in the [the MODFLOW coupling section](../couple/modflow.qmd) of the documentation.

## Upstream and downstream flow

Ribasim's basins can be connected to each other, and each basin expects an
explicit connection. These connections are currently available for inter-basin
flows:

<!-- Is the pump a natural water balance term? -->
1. `Pump`
2. `TabulatedRatingCurve`
3. `LinearResistance`
4. `ManningResistance`

The flow direction of the basin is not pre-determined: flow directions may
freely reverse, provided the connection allows it. Currently, a `LinearResistance`
allows bidirectional flow, but the

Additionally, three additional "connections" area available for the "outmost"
basins (external nodes) in a network.

1. `Terminal`
2. `LevelBoundary`
3. `FlowBoundary`

### Pump and outlet

The behaviour of pumps and outlets is very straight forward if these nodes are not PID controlled. Their flow is given by a fixed flow rate $q$, multiplied by a reduction factor:
$$
Q_\text{pump/outlet} = \phi(u)q
$$

Here $u$ is the storage of the upstream basin. The reduction factor

$$
\phi(u) =
\begin{align}
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{u}{10} &\text{if}& 0 \leq u \le 10 \\
        1 &\text{if}& u \geq 10
    \end{cases}
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-pumpreductionfactor}

makes sure that the flow of the pump goes to $0$ as the upstream basin dries out.

### TabulatedRatingCurve

The Tabulated Rating Curve is a tabulation of a basin's discharge behavior. It describes
a piecewise linear relationship between the basin's level and its
discharge. It can be understood as an empirical description of a basin's
properties. This can include an outlet, but also the lumped hydraulic behavior of the
upstream channels.

<!-- Is this still true? -->
The Tabulated Rating Curve should indicate at which volume no discharge occurs (the dead
storage volume).

:::{.callout-note}
Currently, the discharge relies only on the basin's level; it could also use
the volume of both connected basins to simulate backwater effects, submersion
of outlets, or even reversal of flows for high precipitation events.
:::

### LinearResistance

A `LinearResistance` connects two basins together. The flow between the two basins
is determined by a linear relationship:

$$
    Q = \frac{h_a - h_b}{R}
$$ {#eq-basinflow}

Here $h_a$ is the water level in the first basin, $h_b$ is the water level in
the second basin, and $R$ is the resistance of the link. A `LinearResistance` makes
no assumptions about the direction of the flow: water flows from high to low.

### Terminal

This only allows outflow from a basin into a terminal node.

### LevelBoundary

This can be connected to a basin via a `LinearResistance`. This boundary node will then
exchange water with the basin based on the difference in water level between the two.

### FlowBoundary

This can be connected directly to a basin and prescribes the flow to or from that basin. We require that the edge connecting the flow boundary to the basin should point towards the basin, so that positive flow corresponds to water being added to the model.

### Manning connection

Ribasim is capable of simulating steady flow between basins through a reach
described by a trapezoidal profile and a Manning roughness coefficient.

We describe the discharge from basin $a$ to basin $b$ solely as a function of
the water levels in $a$ and $b$.

$$
Q = f(h_a, h_b)
$$

where:

* The subscripts $a,b$ denote basins
* $h$ is the hydraulic head, or water level

The energy equation for open channel flow is:

$$
H = h + \frac{v^2}{2g}
$$

Where

* $H$ is total head
* $v$ is average water velocity
* $g$ is gravitational acceleration

The discharge $Q$ is defined as:

$$
Q = Av
$$

where $A$ is cross-sectional area.

We use conservation of energy to relate the total head at $a$ to $b$,
with $H_a > H_b$ as follows:

$$
H_a = H_b + h_{\text{loss}}
$$

Or:

$$
h_a + \frac{v_a^2}{2g} = h_b + \frac{v_b^2}{2g} + h_{\text{loss}}
$$

Where $v$ is the average water velocity. $h_{\text{loss}}$ is a combination of
friction and contraction/expansion losses:

$$
h_{\text{loss}} = S_f L + \frac{C}{2g} \left(v_b^2 - v_a^2\right)
$$

Where:

* $L$ is the reach length
* $S_f$ is the representative friction slope
* $C$ is the expansion or contraction coefficient, $0 \le C \le1$

We assume velocity differences in a connection are negligible ($v_a = v_b$):

$$
h_a = h_b + S_f L
$$

Friction losses are computed with the Gauckler-Manning formula:

$$
Q = \frac{A}{n} R_h^\frac{2}{3} \sqrt{S_f}
$$

Where:

* $A$ is the **representative** area.
* $R_h$ is the **representative** wetted radius.
* $S_f$ is the **representative** friction slope.
* $n$ is Manning's roughness coefficient.

We can rewrite to express $S_f$ in terms of Q:

$$
S_f = Q^2 \frac{n^2}{A^2 R_h^{4/3}}
$$

No water is added or removed in a connection:

$$
Q_a = Q_b = Q
$$

Substituting:

$$
h_a = h_b + Q^2 \frac{n^2}{A^2 R_h^{4/3}} L
$$

We can then express $Q$ as a function of head difference $\Delta h$:

$$
Q = \textrm{sign}(\Delta h) \frac{A}{n} R_h^{2/3}\sqrt{\frac{|\Delta h|}{L} }
$$

The $\textrm{sign}(\Delta h)$ term causes the direction of the flow to reverse
if the head in basin $b$ is larger than in basin $a$.

This expression however leads to problems in simulation since the derivative of $Q$
with respect to $\Delta h$ tends to $\pm \infty$ as $\Delta h$ tends to 0. Therefore
we use the slightly modified expression

$$
Q = \textrm{sign}(\Delta h) \frac{A}{n} R_h^{2/3}\sqrt{\frac{\Delta h}{L} s(\Delta h)}
$$

to smooth out this problem. Here $s(x) = \frac{2}{\pi}\arctan{1000x}$ can be thought of as a smooth approximation of the sign function.


:::{.callout-note}
The computation of $S_f$ is not exact: we base it on a representative area and
hydraulic radius, rather than integrating $S_f$ along the length of a reach.
Direct analytic solutions exist for e.g. parabolic profiles (Tolkmitt), but
other profiles requires relatively complicated approaches (such as
approximating the profile with a polynomial).

We use the average value of the cross-sectional area, the average value of the
water depth, and the average value of the hydraulic radius to compute a
friction slope. The size of the resulting error will depend on the water depth
difference between the upstream and downstream basin.
:::

The cross sectional area for a trapezoidal or rectangular profile:

$$
A = w d + \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta z} d^2
$$

Where

* $w$ is the width at $d = 0$ (A triangular profile has $w = 0$)
* $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta z}$ is the slope of the profile expressed as the
  horizontal length for one unit in the vertical (A slope of 45 degrees has
  $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta z} = 1$; a rectangular profile 0).

Accordingly, the wetted perimeter is:

$$
B = w + 2 d \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta z}\right)^2 + 1}
$$


# PID controller {#sec-PID}

The PID controller continuously sets the flow rate of a pump or outlet to bring the level of a certain basin closer to its setpoint. If we denote the setpoint by $\text{SP}(t)$ and the basin level by $y(t)$, then the error is given by
$$
e(t) = \text{SP}(t) - y(t).
$$ {#eq-error}

The output of the PID controller for the flow rate of the pump or outlet is then given by
$$
    Q_\text{PID}(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i\int_{t_0}^t e(\tau)\text{d}\tau + K_d \frac{\text{d}e}{\text{d}t},
$$ {#eq-PIDflow}

for given constant parameters $K_p,K_i,K_d$. The pump or outlet can have associated minimum and maximum flow rates $Q_\min, Q_\max$, and so
$$
Q_\text{pump/outlet} = \text{clip}(\phi(u_\text{us})Q_\text{PID}; Q_\min, Q_\max).
$$

Here $u_\text{us}$ is the storage of the basin upstream of the pump or outlet, $\phi$ is the reduction factor (see @eq-pumpreductionfactor) and

$$
\text{clip}(Q; Q_\min, Q_\max) =
\begin{align}
    \begin{cases}
        Q_\min & \text{if} & Q < Q_\min, \\
        Q & \text{if} & Q_\min \leq Q \leq Q_\max, \\
        Q_\max & \text{if} & Q > Q_\max.
    \end{cases}
\end{align}
$$

For the integral term we denote
$$
I(t) = \int_{t_0}^t e(\tau)\text{d}\tau,
$$

where $t_0$ is the last time the PID controller was made active. $I(t)$ is treated as a state of the system and thus it has its own equation in the system in @eq-system:
$$
\frac{\text{d}I}{\text{d}t} = e(t).
$$

::: {.callout-note}
In the case of the controlled outlet, the upstream node can also be a level boundary. In this case we define $\phi = 1$.
:::

## The derivative term

When $K_d \ne 0$ this adds a level of complexity. We can see this by looking at the error derivative more closely:
$$
\frac{\text{d}e}{\text{d}t} = \frac{\text{d}\text{SP}}{\text{d}t} - \frac{1}{A(u_\text{PID})}\frac{\text{d}u_\text{PID}}{\text{d}t},
$$
where $A(u_\text{PID})$ is the area of the controlled basin as a function of the storage of the controlled basin $u_\text{PID}$. The complexity arises from the fact that $Q_\text{PID}$ is a contribution to $\frac{\text{d}u_\text{PID}}{\text{d}t} = f_\text{PID}$, which makes @eq-PIDflow an implicit equation for $Q_\text{PID}$. We define

$$
f_\text{PID} = \hat{f}_\text{PID} \pm Q_\text{pump/outlet},
$$

that is, $\hat{f}_\text{PID}$ is the right hand side of the ODE for the controlled basin storage state without the contribution of the PID controlled pump. The plus sign holds for an outlet and the minus sign for a pump, dictated by the way the pump and outlet connectivity to the controlled basin is enforced.

Using this, solving @eq-PIDflow for $Q_\text{PID}$ yields
$$
Q_\text{pump/outlet} = \text{clip}\left(\phi(u_\text{us})\frac{K_pe + K_iI + K_d \left(\frac{\text{d}\text{SP}}{\text{d}t}-\frac{\hat{f}_\text{PID}}{A(u_\text{PID})}\right)}{1\pm\phi(u_\text{us})\frac{K_d}{A(u_\text{PID})}};Q_\min,Q_\max\right),
$$
where the clipping is again done last. Note that to compute this, $\hat{f}_\text{PID}$ has to be known first, meaning that the PID controlled pump/outlet flow rate has to be computed after all other contributions to the PID controlled basin's storage are known.

## Jacobian contributions

For convenience here we denote a time derivative of a variable as a dot over te symbol.

For the integral state we simply get the contribution
$$
\frac{\partial \dot{I}}{\partial u_\text{PID}} = - \frac{1}{A(u_\text{PID})}.
$$

Note that when the calculated pump flow lies outside $[Q_\min, Q_\max]$, the pump flow is locally constant and thus all partial derivatives of $Q_\text{pump/outlet}$ with respect to states are $0$. Assuming that it lies in $[Q_\min, Q_\max]$, we derive the Jacobian contributions. Define the enumerator and denominator of the fraction in $Q_\text{pump/outlet}$:

$$
\begin{align}
    E &= K_pe + K_iI + K_d \left(\dot{\text{SP}}-\frac{\hat{f}_\text{PID}}{A(u_\text{PID})}\right) \\
    D &= 1 \pm \phi(u_\text{us})\frac{K_d}{A(u_\text{PID})}
\end{align}
$$

Then

$$
\frac{\partial Q_\text{pump/outlet}}{\partial I} = K_i\frac{\phi(u_\text{us})}{D}.
$$

For the derivative of $Q_\text{pump/outlet}$ with respect to storages we need the derivatives of the enumerator and denominator.

For the denominator we distinguish 2 possibilities:

- If the controlled node is a pump, then $u_\text{us} \equiv u_\text{PID}$ and so $D$ is only a function of $u_\text{PID}$:
$$
\frac{\text{d}D}{\text{d}u_\text{PID}} = - K_d\left[\frac{\phi'(u_\text{PID})}{A(u_\text{PID})}- \phi(u_\text{PID})\frac{A'(u_\text{PID})}{A(u_\text{PID})^2}\right]
$$
- If the controlled node is an outlet, then $D$ is a function of two distinct storages (assuming the upstream node is indeed a basin):
$$
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial D}{\partial u_\text{PID}} &= \phi(u_\text{us})K_d\frac{A'(u_\text{PID})}{A(u_\text{PID})^2}, \\
    \frac{\partial D}{\partial u_\text{us}} &= -\phi'(u_\text{us})K_d\frac{1}{A(u_\text{PID})}.
\end{align}
$$

For the enumerator there distinguish 2 cases:

- The partial derivative with respect to $u_\text{PID}$:
$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial u_\text{PID}} = -\frac{K_p}{A(u_\text{PID})} - K_d\frac{A(u_\text{PID})\frac{\partial\hat{f}_\text{PID}}{\partial u_\text{PID}} - \hat{f}_\text{PID}A'(u_\text{PID})}{A(u_\text{PID})^2}.
$$
- The partial derivative with respect to a different storage $u_i$:
$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial u_i} = - \frac{K_d}{A(u_\text{PID})}\frac{\partial \hat{f}_\text{PID}}{\partial u_i}.
$$

For computational efficiency we exploit that $\phi'$ is mostly $0$. Note that

$$
\frac{\partial\hat{f}_\text{PID}}{\partial u_i} = \hat{J}[i,\text{PID}],
$$
\emph{i.e.} the Jacobian term of the dependence of $u_\text{PID}$ on $u_i$ without the contribution of the PID controlled pump/outlet. Note thus that also the Jacobian contribution of the PID controlled pump can only be computed after the other contributions to the Jacobian are known.

The partial derivatives of $Q_\text{pump}$ are then given by
$$
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial Q_\text{pump}}{\partial u_\text{PID}} &= \phi'(u_\text{PID})\frac{E}{D} + \frac{\phi(u_\text{PID})}{D^2}\left[D\frac{\partial E}{\partial u_\text{PID}} - E\frac{\text{d}D}{\text{d}u_\text{PID}}\right], \\
    \frac{\partial Q_\text{pump}}{\partial u_i} &= \frac{\phi(u_\text{PID})}{D}\frac{\partial E}{\partial u_i} \qquad (i \ne \text{PID}).
\end{align}
$$

The partial derivatives of $Q_\text{outlet}$ are given by
$$
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial Q_\text{outlet}}{\partial u_\text{PID}} &= \frac{\phi(u_\text{us})}{D^2}\left[D\frac{\partial E}{\partial u_\text{PID}} - E\frac{\partial D}{\partial u_\text{PID}}\right], \\
    \frac{\partial Q_\text{outlet}}{\partial u_\text{us}} &= \phi'(u_\text{us})\frac{E}{D} + \frac{\phi(u_\text{us})}{D^2}\left[D\frac{\partial E}{\partial u_\text{us}} - E\frac{\partial D}{\partial u_\text{us}}\right], \\
    \frac{\partial Q_\text{outlet}}{\partial u_i} &= \frac{\phi(u_\text{us})}{D}\frac{\partial E}{\partial u_i} \qquad (i \ne \text{PID, us}).
\end{align}
$$

## The sign of the parameters

Note by @eq-error that the error is positive if the setpoint is larger than the basin level and negative if the setpoint is smaller than the basin level.

We enforce the convention that when a pump is controlled, its edge points away from the basin, and when an outlet is controlled, its edge points towards the basin, so that the main flow direction along these edges is positive. Therefore, positive flows of the pump and outlet have opposite effects on the basin, and thus the parameters $K_p,K_i,K_d$ of the pump and outlet must have oppositive signs to achieve the same goal.

# Numerical solution

Ribasim uses OrdinaryDiffEq.jl to provide a numerical solution to the water
balance equations. Changes to forcings or parameters such as precipitation, but
also the allocated water abstraction is managed through the use of CallBack
functions [@callbacks]. In a coupled run, the exchanges with MODFLOW 6 are also
managed via the use of a callback function.

# Performance

Ribasim needs to be sufficiently fast to make application on the national scale, with
~10000 basins, practical. Therefore, whilst developing, we need to be mindful that
our approach can scale to such a size. We currently simulate a set of 40 connected
free-flowing basins for a period of 2 years in about 10 seconds.

For a real scaling test we would need to do a national simulation, but we expect these
computation times not to be problematic, considering that simulating those same 40 basins
in MODFLOW 6 takes minutes.

There are many things that can influence the calculations times, for instance:

- [Solver tolerance](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/basics/faq/#What-does-tolerance-mean-and-how-much-error-should-I-expect)
    we currently use a very conservative tolerance of `1e-10`, whereas with larger
    tolerances step sizes can easily be 3x longer, leading to a 3x speedup.
- [ODE solvers](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/solvers/ode_solve/): The `Rosenbrock23`
    method we use is robust to oscillations and massive stiffness, however other solvers
    should be tried as well.
- Forcing: Every time new forcing data is injected into the model, it needs to pause.
    Moreover, the larger the forcing fluxes are, the bigger the shock to the system,
    leading to smaller timesteps and thus longer simulation times.

Similarly to other models that solve using a system of equations, like MODFLOW 6, if one
basin takes longer to converge due to extreme forcing, or bad schematization, the system as
a whole need to iterate longer. It is important to be mindful of this, as poor
schematization choices can slow down the model.

When scaling up the model, we will need spend some time to strike the right balance between
error tolerance, schematization and forcing. The SciML software we use has many
[showcases](https://sciml.ai/showcase/) of large scale applications, as well as
documentation on how to achieve the optimal performance for your system.
