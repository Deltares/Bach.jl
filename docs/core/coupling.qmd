# Coupling

## iMOD

Ribasim can also be (online) coupled to other kernels with the help of iMOD Coupler. The corresponding documentation can be found within the [iMOD Suite Documentation](https://deltares.github.io/iMOD-Documentation/coupler.html).

## Water quality

Ribasim can be offline coupled to Delwaq, the Deltares Water Quality model. Note that this functionality is still in active development.

### Setup

Delwaq can calculate the concentration of substances in [Basin](node/basin.qmd) nodes over time, based on initial concentrations, and of [FlowBoundary](node/flow-boundary.qmd) nodes. Ribasim exposes the `Basin / concentration`, `Basin / concentration_state`, `FlowBoundary / concentration`, and `LevelBoundary / concentration` tables to setup these substances and concentrations.

When a Ribasim model ran with the above tables, one can use the utilities in the `coupling/delwaq` folder to generate the input required for Delwaq to run, as well as to parse the output from Delwaq into a Ribasim compatible format.
For more information see the `README.md` in the same folder.
