title: "Pump"
---

Pump water from a source node to a destination node.
The set flow rate will be pumped unless the intake storage is less than $10~m^3$,
in which case the flow rate will be linearly reduced to $0~m^3/s$.
The intake must be either a Basin or LevelBoundary.
When PID controlled, the pump must point away from the controlled basin in terms of edges.
