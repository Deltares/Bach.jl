title: "PidControl"
---

The PidControl node controls the level in a Basin by continuously controlling the flow rate of a connected Pump or Outlet.
See also [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller).

When a PidControl node is made inactive, the node under its control retains the last flow rate value, and the error integral is reset to 0.

In the future controlling the flow on a particular edge could be supported.

## Time

This table is the transient form of the `PidControl` table.
The differences are that a time column is added and the nodes are assumed to be active so this column is removed.
The table must by sorted by time, and per time it must be sorted by `node_id`.
With this the target level and PID coefficients can be updated over time. In between the given times the
these values interpolated linearly, and outside these values area constant given by the
nearest time value.
Note that a `node_id` can be either in this table or in the static one, but not both.
