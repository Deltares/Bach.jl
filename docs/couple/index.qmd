title: "Coupled models"
---

Ribasim can be coupled to other software, for instance to model another process or domain,
or to control a simulation from another process.

To enable this, Ribasim can be compiled as a shared library (`libribasim`) instead of a
command line interface (`ribasim`). This shared library exposes a C API in the form of the
[Basic Model Interface](https://bmi.readthedocs.io/) (BMI). Other software can then load
`libribasim` and load a Ribasim model, exchange data, and control the time stepping.

An initial coupling to MODFLOW 6 was done in 2022 inside the [Julia core](../core/) as a
proof of concept. Read about the [coupling setup](modflow.qmd) and see the
[demonstration](modflow-demo.qmd). Going forward this and other coupling codes will be
implemented outside of the core, by making use of
[iMOD Coupler](https://deltares.github.io/iMOD-Documentation/coupler_index.html) and
`libribasim`. iMOD Coupler is a generic coupling tool, and can be used to couple to other
models as well.
