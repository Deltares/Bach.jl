title: Ribasim
---

Ribasim is a water resources model to simulate the physical behavior of a managed open water system based on a set of control rules and a prioritized water allocation strategy.

Ribasim is written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and is built
on top of the [SciML: Open Source Software for Scientific Machine Learning](https://sciml.ai/)
libraries.

The initial version of Ribasim is developed by [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl) as part of a consortium for the Dutch watersystem.
This activity is co-funded by [TKI Deltatechnology](https://tkideltatechnologie.nl/), a Dutch publicâ€“private partnership innovation program from the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
Ribasim will be used as the surface water module of the [Netherlands Hydrologic Instrument (NHI)](https://nhi.nu/).
