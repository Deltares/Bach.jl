Ribasim is a water resources model to simulate the physical behavior of a managed open water system based on a set of control rules and a prioritized water allocation strategy.

Ribasim is written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and is built
on top of the [SciML: Open Source Software for Scientific Machine Learning](https://sciml.ai/)
libraries.

Ribasim is developed and supported by [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl).
The first version of Ribasim is developed by Deltares as part of a consortium with funding from TKI by Deltares for the Dutch watersystem.
