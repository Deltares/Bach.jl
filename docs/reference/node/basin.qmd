title: "Basin"
---

The Basin is the central node in each schematization, since it is the only one that stores water.
It can exchange water with all other nodes.
The connected nodes determine how water is exchanged; the Basin has no flow behavior of its own.

# Tables

## Static

The `Basin / static` table can be used to set the static value of variables. The time table has a
similar schema, with the time column added. A static value for a variable is only used if
there is no dynamic forcing data for that variable. Specifically, if there is either no
time table, it is empty, or all timestamps of that variable are missing.

column                | type    | unit         | restriction
---------             | ------- | ------------ | -----------
node_id               | Int32   | -            | sorted
precipitation         | Float64 | $m s^{-1}$   | non-negative
potential_evaporation | Float64 | $m s^{-1}$   | non-negative
drainage              | Float64 | $m^3 s^{-1}$ | non-negative
infiltration          | Float64 | $m^3 s^{-1}$ | non-negative
urban_runoff          | Float64 | $m^3 s^{-1}$ | non-negative

Note that if variables are not set in the static table, default values are used when
possible. These are generally zero, e.g. no precipitation, no inflow. If it is not possible
to have a reasonable and safe default, a value must be provided in the static table.

## Time

This table is the transient form of the `Basin` table.
The only difference is that a time column is added.
The table must by sorted by time, and per time it must be sorted by `node_id`.
At the given timestamps the values are set in the simulation, such that the timeseries can be seen as forward filled.

## State

The state table aims to capture the full state of the Basin, such that it can be used as an
initial condition, potentially the outcome of an earlier simulation. Currently only the
Basin node types have state.

column    | type    | unit         | restriction
--------- | ------- | ------------ | -----------
node_id   | Int32   | -            | sorted
level     | Float64 | $m$          | $\ge$ basin bottom

Each Basin ID needs to be in the table.

## Profile

The profile table defines the physical dimensions of the storage reservoir of each basin.

column    | type    | unit         | restriction
--------- | ------- | ------------ | -----------
node_id   | Int32   | -            | sorted
area      | Float64 | $m^2$        | non-negative, per node_id: start positive and not decreasing
level     | Float64 | $m$          | per node_id: increasing

The level is the level at the basin outlet. All levels are defined in meters above a datum
that is the same for the entire model. An example of the first 5 rows of such a table is
given below. The first 4 rows define the profile of ID `2`. The number of rows can vary
per ID, and must be at least 2. Using a very large number of rows may impact performance.

node_id |   area | level
------- |------- |-------
      2 |    1.0 |   6.0
      2 | 1000.0 |   7.0
      2 | 1000.0 |   9.0
      3 |    1.0 |   2.2

We use the symbol $A$ for area, $h$ for level and $S$ for storage.
The profile provides a function $A(h)$ for each basin.
Internally this get converted to two functions, $A(S)$ and $h(S)$, by integrating over the function, setting the storage to zero for the bottom of the profile.
The minimum area cannot be zero to avoid numerical issues.
The maximum area is used to convert the precipitation flux into an inflow.

## Area

The optional area table is not used during computation, but provides a place to associate areas in the form of polygons to Basins.
Using this makes it easier to recognize which water or land surfaces are represented by Basins.

column    | type                    | restriction
--------- | ----------------------- | -----------
node_id   | Int32                   | sorted
geom      | Polygon or MultiPolygon | (optional)

## Subgrid

The subgrid table defines a piecewise linear interpolation from a basin water level to a subgrid element water level.
Many subgrid elements may be associated with a single basin, each with distinct interpolation functions.
This functionality can be used to translate a single lumped basin level to a more spatially detailed representation (e.g comparable to the output of a hydrodynamic simulation).

column        | type    | unit  | restriction
------------- | ------- | ----- | ------------------------
subgrid_id    | Int32   | -     | sorted
node_id       | Int32   | -     | constant per subgrid_id
basin_level   | Float64 | $m$   | sorted per subgrid_id
subgrid_level | Float64 | $m$   | sorted per subgrid_id

The table below shows example input for two subgrid elements:

subgrid_id | node_id | basin_level | subgrid_level
---------- | ------- | ----------- | -------------
         1 |       9 |         0.0 |           0.0
         1 |       9 |         1.0 |           1.0
         1 |       9 |         2.0 |           2.0
         2 |       9 |         0.0 |           0.5
         2 |       9 |         1.0 |           1.5
         2 |       9 |         2.0 |           2.5

Both subgrid elements use the water level of the basin with `node_id` 9 to interpolate to their respective water levels.
The first element has a one to one connection with the water level; the second also has a one to one connection, but is offset by half a meter.
A basin water level of 0.3 would be translated to a water level of 0.3 for the first subgrid element, and 0.8 for the second.
Water levels beyond the last `basin_level` are linearly extrapolated.

Note that the interpolation to subgrid water level is not constrained by any water balance within Ribasim.
Generally, to create physically meaningful subgrid water levels, the subgrid table must be parametrized properly such that the spatially integrated water volume of the subgrid elements agrees with the total storage volume of the basin.

## Concentration {#sec-basin-conc}

# Equations

## The reduction factor {#sec-reduction_factor}
At several points in the equations below a *reduction factor* is used. This is a term that makes certain transitions more smooth, for instance when a pump stops providing water when its source basin dries up. The reduction factor is given by

\begin{align}
    \phi(x; p) =
    \begin{cases}
    0 &\text{if}\quad x < 0 \\
        -2 \left(\frac{x}{p}\right)^3 + 3\left(\frac{x}{p}\right)^2 &\text{if}\quad 0 \le x \le p \\
        1 &\text{if}\quad x > p
    \end{cases}
\end{align}

Here $p > 0$ is the threshold value which determines the interval $[0,p]$ of the smooth transition between $0$ and $1$, see the plot below.

```{python}
# | code-fold: true
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def f(x, p = 3):
    x_scaled = x / p
    phi = (-2 * x_scaled + 3) * x_scaled**2
    phi = np.where(x < 0, 0, phi)
    phi = np.where(x > p, 1, phi)

    return phi

fontsize = 15
p = 3
N = 100
x_min = -1
x_max = 4
x = np.linspace(x_min,x_max,N)
phi = f(x,p)

fig,ax = plt.subplots(dpi=80)
ax.plot(x,phi)

y_lim = ax.get_ylim()

ax.set_xticks([0,p], [0,"$p$"], fontsize=fontsize)
ax.set_yticks([0,1], [0,1], fontsize=fontsize)
ax.hlines([0,1],x_min,x_max, color = "k", ls = ":", zorder=-1)
ax.vlines([0,p], *y_lim, color = "k", ls = ":")
ax.set_xlim(x_min,x_max)
ax.set_xlabel("$x$", fontsize=fontsize)
ax.set_ylabel(r"$\phi(x;p)$", fontsize=fontsize)
ax.set_ylim(y_lim)

fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Precipitation

The precipitation term is given by

$$
    Q_P = P \cdot A.
$$ {#eq-precip}

Here $P = P(t)$ is the precipitation rate and $A$ is the maximum area given in the `Basin / profile` table.
Precipitation in the Basin area is assumed to be directly added to the Basin storage.
The modeler needs to ensure all precipitation enters the model, and there is no overlap in the maximum profile areas, otherwise extra water is created.
If a part of the catchment is not in any Basin profile, the modeler has to verify that water source is not forgotten.
It can for instance be converted to a flow rate and added to a Basin as a FlowBoundary.

## Evaporation

The evaporation term is given by

$$
    Q_E = E_\text{pot} \cdot A(u) \cdot \phi(d;0.1).
$$ {#eq-evap}

Here $E_\text{pot} = E_\text{pot}(t)$ is the potential evaporation rate and $A$ is the wetted area.
$\phi$ is the [reduction factor](/concept/equations.qmd#sec-reduction_factor) which depends on the depth $d$.
It provides a smooth gradient as $u \rightarrow 0$.

A straightforward formulation $Q_E = \mathrm{max}(E_\text{pot} A(u), 0)$ is unsuitable, as $\frac{\mathrm{d}Q_E}{\mathrm{d}u}(u=0)$ is not well-defined.

A non-smooth derivative results in extremely small timesteps and long computation time.
In a physical interpretation, evaporation is switched on or off per individual droplet of water.
In general, the effect of the reduction term is negligible, or not even necessary.
As a surface water dries, its wetted area decreases and so does the evaporative flux.
However, for (simplified) cases with constant wetted surface (a rectangular profile), evaporation only stops at $u = 0$.

## Infiltration and Drainage

Infiltration is provided as a lump sum for the Basin.
If Ribasim is coupled with MODFLOW 6, the infiltration is computed as the sum of all **positive** flows of the MODFLOW 6 boundary conditions in the Basin:

$$
    Q_\text{inf} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \max(Q_{\mathrm{mf6}_{i,j}}, 0.0)
$$ {#eq-inf}

Where $i$ is the index of the boundary condition, $j$ the MODFLOW 6 cell index, $n$ the number of boundary conditions, and $m$ the number of MODFLOW 6 cells in the Basin.
$Q_{\mathrm{mf6}_{i,j}}$ is the flow computed by MODFLOW 6 for cell $j$ for boundary condition $i$.

Drainage is a lump sum for the Basin, and consists of the sum of the absolute value of all **negative** flows of the MODFLOW 6 boundary conditions in the Basin.

$$
    Q_\text{drn} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \left| \min(Q_{\mathrm{mf6}_{i,j}}, 0.0) \right|
$$ {#eq-drn}

The interaction with MODFLOW 6 boundary conditions is explained in greater detail in the [the iMOD Coupler docs](https://deltares.github.io/iMOD-Documentation/coupler.html).
