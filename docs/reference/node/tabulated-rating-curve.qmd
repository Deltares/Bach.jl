title: "TabulatedRatingCurve"
---

A TabulatedRatingCurve determines outflow from a Basin by looking up the flow rate that corresponds to the current upstream level from a rating curve.
The TabulatedRatingCurve takes a rating curve as input.
Use it for instance to model flow over a weir.

# Tables

## Static

column        | type    | unit         | restriction
------------- | ------- | ------------ | -----------
node_id       | Int32   | -            | sorted
control_state | String  | -            | (optional) sorted per node_id
active        | Bool    | -            | (optional, default true)
level         | Float64 | $m$          | sorted per control_state, unique
flow_rate     | Float64 | $m^3 s^{-1}$ | start at 0, increasing

Thus a single rating curve can be given by the following table:

node_id | flow_rate  | level
------- |----------- |-------
      2 | 0.0        | -0.10
      2 | 0.0001     |  0.09
      2 | 0.01       |  0.29
      2 | 0.9        | 20.09

Below the lowest given level of -0.10, the flow rate is kept at 0.
Between given levels the flow rate is interpolated linearly.
Above the maximum given level of 20.09, the flow rate keeps increases linearly according to the slope of the last segment.

## Time

This table is the transient form of the `TabulatedRatingCurve` table.
The only difference is that a time column is added.
The table must by sorted by time, and per time it must be sorted by `node_id`.
With this the rating curves can be updated over time.
Note that a `node_id` can be either in this table or in the static one, but not both.

column    | type     | unit         | restriction
--------- | -------  | ------------ | -----------
node_id   | Int32    | -            | sorted
time      | DateTime | -            | sorted per node_id
level     | Float64  | $m$          | sorted per node_id per time
flow_rate | Float64  | $m^3 s^{-1}$ | non-negative
