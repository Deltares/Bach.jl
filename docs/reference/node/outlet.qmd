title: "Outlet"
---

The Outlet lets water flow downstream with a prescribed flow rate.
It is similar to the Pump, with two additional physical constraints:

1. Water only flows down, by gravity
2. The upstream level must be above the minimum crest level if the upstream level is defined.

When PID controlled, the outlet must point towards the controlled basin in terms of edges.
