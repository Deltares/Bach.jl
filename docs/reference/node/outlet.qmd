title: "Outlet"
---

The Outlet lets water flow downstream with a prescribed flow rate.
It is similar to the Pump, with two additional physical constraints:

1. Water only flows down, by gravity
2. The upstream level must be above the minimum crest level if the upstream level is defined.

When PID controlled, the outlet must point towards the controlled basin in terms of edges.

# Equations

The Outlet is very similar to the Pump, but it has a few extra [reduction factors](/concept/equations.qmd#sec-reduction_factor) for physical constraints:

$$
Q = \mathrm{clamp}(\phi(u_a; 10.0)\phi(\Delta h; 0.1) \phi(h_a-h_\text{min};0.1) Q_\text{set}, Q_{\min}, Q_{\max})
$$

$Q$ is the realized Outlet flow rate.
$Q_\text{set}$ is the Outlet's target `flow_rate`.
$Q_{\min}$ and $Q_{\max}$ are the Outlet `min_flow_rate` and `max_flow_rate`.
The subscript $a$ denotes the upstream node and $b$ the downstream node.
The first reduction factor reduces flow from a drying upstream Basin.
The second one makes sure that the Outlet flow goes to zero as the head difference $\Delta h = h_a - h_b$ goes to zero.
The last one makes sure that the Outlet only produces flow when the upstream level is above the minimum crest level $h_\text{min}$.


Not all node types upstream or downstream of the Outlet have a defined level.
If this is the case, and therefore the reduction factor cannot be computed, it is defined to be $1.0$.
