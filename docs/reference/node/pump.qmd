title: "Pump"
---

Pump water from a source node to a destination node.
The set flow rate will be pumped unless the intake storage is less than $10~m^3$,
in which case the flow rate will be linearly reduced to $0~m^3/s$.
The intake must be either a Basin or LevelBoundary.
When PID controlled, the pump must point away from the controlled basin in terms of edges.

# Equations

The behavior of a Pump is simple if these nodes are not PID controlled.
Their flow is given by a fixed flow rate $q$, multiplied by a reduction factor:

$$
Q = \mathrm{clamp}(\phi(u; 10.0) Q_\text{set}, Q_{\min}, Q_{\max})
$$

$Q$ is the realized Pump flow rate.
$Q_\text{set}$ is the Pump's target `flow_rate`.
$Q_{\min}$ and $Q_{\max}$ are the Pump `min_flow_rate` and `max_flow_rate`.
$u$ is the storage of the incoming Basin.
The [reduction factor](/concept/equations.qmd#sec-reduction_factor) $\phi$ makes sure that the flow of the Pump goes smoothly to $0$ as the incoming Basin dries out.
