# Pump { #ribasim.Pump }

`Pump()`

Pump water from a source node to a destination node.
The set flow rate will be pumped unless the intake storage is less than 10m3,
in which case the flow rate will be linearly reduced to 0 m3/s.
A negative flow rate means pumping against the edge direction.
Note that the intake must always be a Basin.
