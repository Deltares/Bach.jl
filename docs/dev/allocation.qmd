If allocation is used in a model, [Allocation struct](https://deltares.github.io/Ribasim/dev/allocation.html#the-allocation-struct)(s) are created.
Allocation struct stores the data that is needed for calculation and the result of the calculation.
In allocation, optimization is an essential part.
The JuMP model is used to model and solve the optimization problems that come up in the allocation.
The [AllocationModel struct](https://deltares.github.io/Ribasim/dev/allocation.html#the-allocation-struct) is used for constructing the JuMP model.
When an instance of `AllocationModel` is created, a JuMP optimization model is defined and initialized in the instance.
More details on how allocation interacts with `JuMP.jl` is explained [here](https://deltares.github.io/Ribasim/dev/allocation.html#jump.jl-problem-interaction).

After initialization, as the simulation starts, the allocation problem is solved and updated at every time step.
In each iteration, data needed for comuptation are updated.
The parameters of the optimization problem are also updated.
The optimization problem are solved and the data of the result are saved.

The update of allocation (`update_allocation`) is repeating and spread into three parts.
They are updating the mean flows, ["collect demand" and "allocate"](https://deltares.github.io/Ribasim/concept/allocation.html#the-high-level-algorithm).
The mean flow data is used for the iMOD coupler.
The steps "collect demand" and "allocate" correspond to the function `collect_demand` and `allocate_demand` in the code.

The iteration stops when it reaches the end time step.

## The `Allocation` struct

The `Allocation` struct stores necessary data and calculation results.

|field     | type              |  description|
|------------ | -------- |---------------------------------------- |
|subnetwork_ids     | Vector{Int32}     | The unique sorted allocation network IDs|
|allocation_models     | AllocationModel   | The allocation models for the main network and subnetworks corresponding to subnetwork_ids|
|main_network_connections  |Vector{Vector{Tuple{NodeID, NodeID}}} | (from_id, to_id) from the main network to the subnetwork per subnetwork|
|priorities        |Vector{Int32}| All used priority values.|
|subnetwork_demands   | Dict{Tuple{NodeID, NodeID}, Vector{Float64}}   | The demand of an edge from the main network to a subnetwork|
|subnetwork_allocateds |Dict{Tuple{NodeID, NodeID}, Vector{Float64}}   | The allocated flow of an edge from the main network to a subnetwork|
|mean_input_flows    |  Dict{Tuple{NodeID, NodeID}, Float64}   | Flows averaged over Δt_allocation over edges that are allocation sources|
|mean_realized_flows  | Dict{Tuple{NodeID, NodeID}, Float64}   | Flows averaged over Δt_allocation over edges that realize a demand|
|record_demand      |      | A record of demands and allocated flows for nodes that have these|
|record_flow       |       | A record of all flows computed by allocation optimization, eventually saved to output file|

## The `AllocationModel` struct

The `AllocationModel` struct has all the data that is needed for the JuMP optimization problem.

|field     | type              |  description|
|------------  | -------- |---------------------------------------- |
|subnetwork_id |Int32 |The ID of this allocation network|
|capacity | JuMP.Containers.SparseAxisArray | The capacity per edge of the allocation network, as constrained by nodes that have a max_flow_rate|
|problem | JuMP.Model | The JuMP.jl model for solving the allocation problem|
|Δt_allocation | Float64 | The time interval between consecutive allocation solves   |

## `JuMP.jl` problem interaction
When working with optimization problems using JuMP, there are three fundamental components that need to be defined:

- Optimization variables: These are the [variables](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/api/JuMP/#@constraints) that are optimized in the optimization problem in allocation.
They are defined using the [`@variable`](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/api/JuMP/#@variables) macro.
For example, to specify the flow rates in all the edges in the allocation network as variables:

```julia
problem[:F] = JuMP.@variable(problem, F[edge = edges] >= 0.0)
```

More details about setting up variables in allocation can be found in the section [below](https://deltares.github.io/Ribasim/dev/allocation.html#optimization-problem).

- Constraints: These are the constraints that the optimization variables must satisfy.
They are defined using the [`@constraint`](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/api/JuMP/#@constraints) macro.
The definition of the edge capacity constraints is shown in section [below](https://deltares.github.io/Ribasim/dev/allocation.html#setting-the-constraints-and-capacities).
`add_constraints_...` functions are used to [add constraints](https://deltares.github.io/Ribasim/dev/allocation.html#setting-up-initial-optimization-constraints) to the optimization problem.
The [initial value of the constraints](https://deltares.github.io/Ribasim/dev/allocation.html#setting-the-constraints-and-capacities) is set in the function `set_initial_values_...`.
During the iteration, the constraints are updated based on the current state of the allocation network.
When [looping over priorities](https://deltares.github.io/Ribasim/dev/allocation.html#updating-capacities), the constraints are updated by the function `adjust_...`.

- Objective function: This is the function that sets the objective of the optimization problem.
It is defined using the [`@objective`](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/api/JuMP/#@objective) macro.

During the computation, functions `JuMP.normalized_rhs` and `JuMP.set_normalized_rhs` are used to update the constraints.

For example, to update the capacity of one of the edges, `JuMP.normalized_rhs` moves all the constants to the right-hand sides and all variables to the left-hand side and `JuMP.set_normalized_rhs` sets the new right-hand-side value.
```julia
JuMP.set_normalized_rhs(
    constraints_capacity[edge_id],
    JuMP.normalized_rhs(constraints_capacity[edge_id]) - JuMP.value(F[edge_id]),
)
```

Some JuMP data structures are used to store intermediate or result data. For more information, please visit [JuMP API](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/api/JuMP/).

# Initialization
Initialization of the allocation data structures happens in `allocation_init.jl`. Below the steps of allocation problem initialization are explained.

For each subnetwork, an allocation problem is made, which is stored in the `allocation_models` field mentioned above.

## Data processing
### Deriving edge capacities

Edge capacities are important constraints in the optimization problem. Obtaining the capacities of all the flow edges in the subnetworks. The capacity of an edge is given by the smallest `max_flow_rate` of the nodes connected to the edges if these nodes have such a value. The capacities are stored in a `SparseArray` object from `JuMP.jl` called `capacities`, indexed by a tuple of node IDs.

The function `get_capacity` obtains the capacities given a subnetwork ID and the Ribasim model parameters `p`, if the sources of the subnetwork are valid (checked in function `valid_sources`).

### Handling the connection between the main network and subnetworks
function `find_subnetwork_connetions` finds the edges connected to the main network and a subnetwork. `subnetwork_demands` and `subnetwork_allocateds` will be created.
`main_network_connection` is a vector of edges that connect a subnetwork with the main network.

## Optimization problem
### Setting up optimization variables
There are three types of variables in the optimization problems:

- flows between the edges in the allocation model
- flows in and out of a basin with a level demand
- flows in and out of nodes that have a buffer, which are nodes that have a flow demand or have fractional flow outneighbors

The function `add_variables_flow` is used to add the variable of flows between the edges. The variables are retracted from the capacity array.
And variables named by `F($startnode, $endnode)` are created.

```julia
edges = keys(capacity.data)
problem[:F] = JuMP.@variable(problem, F[edge = edges] >= 0.0)
```

In the function `add_variables_basin`, variables that represent flows of those basins that are connected with level demand are defined.
Part of the function is shown in the code block below.
A variable is named `F_basin_in` if the corresponding basin is supplied by a level demand and `F_basin_out` if consumed by a level demand.

```julia
# Get the node IDs from the subnetwork for basins that have a level demand
node_ids_basin = [
    node_id for
    node_id in graph[].node_ids[subnetwork_id] if graph[node_id].type == :basin &&
    has_external_demand(graph, node_id, :level_demand)[1]
]
problem[:F_basin_in] =
    JuMP.@variable(problem, F_basin_in[node_id = node_ids_basin,] >= 0.0)
problem[:F_basin_out] =
    JuMP.@variable(problem, F_basin_out[node_id = node_ids_basin,] >= 0.0)
```

The last set of optimization variables is the flow edges connected with a flow demand or fractional flow outneighbor. It is defined in a similar way to the second set of variables.

### Setting up initial optimization constraints
All the variables are greater and equal to 0. This is set when the variables are added to the optimization problem.

Other constraints are capacity, `source_user`, `source`, `flow_conservation`, `fractional_flow`, `basin_outflow`, `flow_buffer_outflow` and `flow_demand_outflow`.

For each set of constraints, a function named `add_constrains_[constraints name]` is created.

Take `add_constraints_user_source` as an example, the nodes that are relevant for the constraints are added to the optimization problem by calling JuMP.\@constraint.

```julia
node_ids_user = [node_id for node_id in node_ids if node_id.type == NodeType.UserDemand]

problem[:source_user] = JuMP.@constraint(
    problem,
    [node_id = node_ids_user],
    F[(node_id, outflow_id(graph, node_id))] <= 0.0,
    base_name = "source_user"
)
```

# Optimization
The initialization and iteration of the optimization problems are implemented in `allocation_optim.jl`.

## Preparing the optimization problem
### Setting up the objective function
The optimization objective is sum of three quadratic error terms.
The quadratic terms are defined with function `add_objective_term`.

In `set_objective_priority`, it set objective function for a given priority.
First it treat subnetwork as user demand and add the quadratic terms of main network.
Then it loop over all the edge in allocation.
Based on the type of the node the edge pointing to (user demand or flow demand), it adds the corresponding quadratic terms.
Finally, it does same to the edge that start from level demand node.

### Setting the constraints and capacities
In the function `set_initial_values` capacities and demands are initialized. As shown below, these functions set the capacities of source, edge, basin, buffer and demands to the corresponding initial values.
```julia
set_initial_capacities_source!(allocation_model, p)
set_initial_capacities_edge!(allocation_model, p)
set_initial_capacities_basin!(allocation_model, p, u, t)
set_initial_capacities_buffer!(allocation_model)
set_initial_capacities_returnflow!(allocation_model)

set_initial_demands_user!(allocation_model, p, t)
set_initial_demands_level!(allocation_model, u, p, t)
set_initial_demands_flow!(allocation_model, p, t)
```

These capacities determine the constraints of the optimization problem.
Take `set_initial_capacities_source` as an example, the right-hand-side value of the `source_constraints` are set to the `source_capacity`.

```julia
for edge_metadata in values(graph.edge_data)
    (; edge) = edge_metadata
    if graph[edge...].subnetwork_id_source == subnetwork_id
        # If it is a source edge for this allocation problem
        if edge ∉ main_network_source_edges
            # Reset the source to the averaged flow over the last allocation period
            source_capacity = mean_input_flows[edge][]
            JuMP.set_normalized_rhs(
                source_constraints[edge],
                # It is assumed that the allocation procedure does not have to be differentiated.
                source_capacity,
            )
        end
    end
end
```

Apart from the `set_initial_` function above, capacities of `inlet` is the allocated capacities from main network to subnetwork.
Source constraints will be adapted based on the optimization type.
This function is called separately and thus not part of the `set_initial_values`.

## Looping over priorities
### Updating capacities
While optimizing a given priority, `set_capacities_flow_demand_outflow` update constraints `flow_demand_outflow`.
If the current priority is the same as the priority of the flow demand, constraints will be infinite, otherwise 0.

Optimization objective function is updated based on the new flow demand and the given priority and the optimization solver is called.

If a solution is found by the solver, the allocation result will be updated. And it will be [saved](allocation.qmd#output-data), so the [physical layer](allocation.qmd#communicating-to-the-physical-layer) can make use of it.

Lastly, capacities and demands are updated, as shown below:

```julia
adjust_capacities_source!(allocation_model)
adjust_capacities_edge!(allocation_model)
adjust_capacities_basin!(allocation_model)
adjust_capacities_buffer!(allocation_model)
adjust_capacities_returnflow!(allocation_model, p)

for parameter in propertynames(p)
    demand_node = getfield(p, parameter)
    if demand_node isa AbstractDemandNode
        adjust_demands!(allocation_model, p, priority_idx, demand_node)
    end
end
```

## Output data
Function `save_demands_and_allocations` and `save_allocation_flows` save the allocated flow to corresponding nodes and edge in the subnetworks.

## Communicating to the physical layer
The function `assign_allocations` update subnetwork demand (`collect_demand`) or assign the allocated amount to user (`allocate`) with the result of the optimization.
Then it also writes the resulted flow to `Allocation` object.
