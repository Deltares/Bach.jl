If allocation is used in a model, Allocation struct is created.
Allocation struct stores the data that is needed for calculation and the result of the calculation.
Optimization is an essential part of allocation.
JuMP model is used to model and solve the optimization problems that come up in the allocation.
AllocationModel struct is used for constructing JuMP problem.
When a Allocation model is created, a JuMP optimization model is defined and initialized in the allocation model.

After initialization, as the simulation start, allocation problem is solved and updated on every time step.
In each iteration, data that is needed for comuptation are updated.
And parameters of optimization problem are also updated.
Optimization problem are solved and the data of the result are saved.

The update of allocation are spread in three parts. They are updating

## The `Allocation` struct

Allocation struct stores all information about allocation.

|field     | type              |  description|
|------------ | -------- |---------------------------------------- |
|subnetwork_ids     | Vector{Int32}     | The unique sorted allocation network IDs|
|allocation_models     | AllocationModel   | The allocation models for the main network and subnetworks corresponding to subnetwork_ids|
|main_network_connections  |Vector{Vector{Tuple{NodeID, NodeID}}}| (from_id, to_id) from the main network to the subnetwork per subnetwork|
|priorities        |Vector{Int32}| All used priority values.|
|subnetwork_demands   | Dict{Tuple{NodeID, NodeID}, Vector{Float64}}   | The demand of an edge from the main network to a subnetwork|
|subnetwork_allocateds |Dict{Tuple{NodeID, NodeID}, Vector{Float64}}   | The allocated flow of an edge from the main network to a subnetwork|
|mean_input_flows    |  Dict{Tuple{NodeID, NodeID}, Float64}   | Flows averaged over Δt_allocation over edges that are allocation sources|
|mean_realized_flows  | Dict{Tuple{NodeID, NodeID}, Float64}   | Flows averaged over Δt_allocation over edges that realize a demand|
|record_demand      |      | A record of demands and allocated flows for nodes that have these|
|record_flow       |       | A record of all flows computed by allocation optimization, eventually saved to output file|

## The `AllocationModel` struct

`AllocationModel` struct has all information that is needed for JuMP optimization.

|field     | type              |  description|
|------------  | -------- |---------------------------------------- |
|subnetwork_id |Int32 |The ID of this allocation network|
|capacity | JuMP.Containers.SparseAxisArray | The capacity per edge of the allocation network, as constrained by nodes that have a max_flow_rate|
|problem | JuMP.Model | The JuMP.jl model for solving the allocation problem|
|Δt_allocation | Float64 | The time interval between consecutive allocation solves   |

## `JuMP.jl` problem interaction
We used this julia package to model and solve the optimization in the allocation.

In allocation, the optimization problem object is named `problem`and is an instance from class `JuMP.Model`.
Basic components in an optimization problem are optimized variable ([JuMP.\@variable](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/api/JuMP/#@variables)),  constraint ([JuMP.\@constraints](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/api/JuMP/#@constraints)) and objective function ([JuMP.\@objective](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/api/JuMP/#@objective)).

For example, to specify the flow rates in all the edges in the allocation network as variables:
```julia
problem[:F] = JuMP.@variable(problem, F[edge = edges] >= 0.0)
```
where `F[edge = edges]` returns a vector of variables named by their edge.

During the computation, functions `JuMP.normalized_rhs` and `JuMP.set_normalized_rhs` are used for updating the constraints.

For example, to update the capacity of one of the edge, `JuMP.normalized_rhs` moves all the constant to the right-hand sides and all variables to the left-hand side and `JuMP.set_normalized_rhs` sets the new right-hand-side value.
```julia
JuMP.set_normalized_rhs(
    constraints_capacity[edge_id],
    JuMP.normalized_rhs(constraints_capacity[edge_id]) - JuMP.value(F[edge_id]),
)
```

Some JuMP data structures are used for storing intermediate or result data. For more information, please visit [JuMP API](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/api/JuMP/).

# Initialization
Initialization of the allocation data structures happens in `allocation_init.jl`. Below the steps of allocation problem initialization are explained.

For each subnetwork, a allocation problem is made, which is stored in the `allocation_models` field mentioned above.

## Data processing
### Deriving edge capacities

Edge capacities are important constraints in the optimization problem. Obtaining the capacities of all the flow edges in subnetwork. The capacity of an edge is given by the smallest `max_flow_rate` of the nodes connected to the edges, if these nodes have such a value. The capacities are stored in a `SparseArray` object from `JuMP.jl` called `capacities`, indexed by a tuple of node IDs.

The function `get_capacity` obtains the capacities given a subnetwork ID and the Ribasim model parameters `p`, if the sources of the subnetwork are valid (checked in function `valid_sources`).

### Handling the connection between the main network and subnetworks
function `find_subnetwork_connetions` finds the edges connected to the main network and a subnetwork. `subnetwork_demands` and `subnetwork_allocateds` will be created.
`main_network_connection` is a vector of edges that connect a subnetwork with the main network.

## Optimization problem
### Setting up optimization variables
There are three types of variables in the optimization problems:

- flows between the edges in allocation model
- flows in and out of a basin with a level demand
- flows in and out of nodes that have a buffer, which are nodes that have a flow demand or have fractional flow outneighbors

To add variable of flow, In the function `add_variables_flow`, flow edges are retracted from capacity array. And variable named by `F($startnode, $endnode)` are created.

```julia
edges = keys(capacity.data)
problem[:F] = JuMP.@variable(problem, F[edge = edges] >= 0.0)
```

In the function `add_variables_basin`, variable that represent flows of those basins that connected with level demand are defined.
Part of the function is shown in the code block below.
The variable is named `F_basin_in` if basin supplied by the basins with a level demand and `F_basin_out` if consumed by a level demand.

```julia
# Get the node IDs from the subnetwork for basins that have a level demand
node_ids_basin = [
    node_id for
    node_id in graph[].node_ids[subnetwork_id] if graph[node_id].type == :basin &&
    has_external_demand(graph, node_id, :level_demand)[1]
]
problem[:F_basin_in] =
    JuMP.@variable(problem, F_basin_in[node_id = node_ids_basin,] >= 0.0)
problem[:F_basin_out] =
    JuMP.@variable(problem, F_basin_out[node_id = node_ids_basin,] >= 0.0)
```

The last set of optimization variables are the flows with  flow demand or fractional flow outneighbors. It is defined in a similar way to the second set of variables.

### Setting up initial optimization constraints
All the variable are greater and equal to 0. This is set when the variable are added to the optimization problem.

Other constraints are capacity, `source_user`, `source`, `flow_conservation`, `fractional_flow`, `basin_outflow`, `flow_buffer_outflow` and `flow_demand_outflow`.

For each set of constraints, a function named `add_constrains_[constraints name]` is created.

Take `add_constraints_user_source` as an example, the node that is relevant to the constraints are filtered.
Then a set of constraints are added by calling JuMP.\@constraint.

```julia
node_ids_user = [node_id for node_id in node_ids if node_id.type == NodeType.UserDemand]

problem[:source_user] = JuMP.@constraint(
    problem,
    [node_id = node_ids_user],
    F[(node_id, outflow_id(graph, node_id))] <= 0.0,
    base_name = "source_user"
)
```

# Optimization

## Preparing the optimization problem
### Setting up the objective function
The optimization objective is sum of three quadratic error terms.
The quadratic terms are defined with function `add_objective_term`.

In `set_objective_priority`, it set objective function for a given priority.
First it treat subnetwork as user demand and add the quadratic terms of main network.
Then it loop over all the edge in allocation.
Based on the type of the node the edge pointing to (user demand or flow demand), it adds the corresponding quadratic terms.
Finally, it does same to the edge that start from level demand node.

### Setting the constraints and capacities
In the function `set_initial_values` capacities and demands are initialized. As shown below, these functions set the capacities of source, edge, basin, buffer and demands to the corresponding initial values.
```julia
set_initial_capacities_source!(allocation_model, p)
set_initial_capacities_edge!(allocation_model, p)
set_initial_capacities_basin!(allocation_model, p, u, t)
set_initial_capacities_buffer!(allocation_model)
set_initial_capacities_returnflow!(allocation_model)

set_initial_demands_user!(allocation_model, p, t)
set_initial_demands_level!(allocation_model, u, p, t)
set_initial_demands_flow!(allocation_model, p, t)
```

These capacities determine the constraints of the optimization problem.
Take `set_initial_capacities_source` as an example, the right-hand-side value of the `source_constraints` are set to the `source_capacity`.

```julia
for edge_metadata in values(graph.edge_data)
    (; edge) = edge_metadata
    if graph[edge...].subnetwork_id_source == subnetwork_id
        # If it is a source edge for this allocation problem
        if edge ∉ main_network_source_edges
            # Reset the source to the averaged flow over the last allocation period
            source_capacity = mean_input_flows[edge][]
            JuMP.set_normalized_rhs(
                source_constraints[edge],
                # It is assumed that the allocation procedure does not have to be differentiated.
                source_capacity,
            )
        end
    end
end
```

Apart from the `set_initial_` function above, capacities of `inlet` is the allocated capacities from main network to subnetwork.
Source constraints will be adapted based on the optimization type.
This function is called separately and thus not part of the `set_initial_values`.

## Looping over priorities
### Updating capacities
While optimizing a given priority, `set_capacities_flow_demand_outflow` update constraints `flow_demand_outflow`.
If the current priority is the same as the priority of the flow demand, constraints will be infinite, otherwise 0.

Optimization objective function is updated based on the new flow demand and the given priority and the optimization solver is called.

If a solution is found by the solver, the allocation result will be updated. And it will be [saved](allocation.qmd#output-data), so the [physical layer](allocation.qmd#communicating-to-the-physical-layer) can make use of it.

Lastly, capacities and demands are updated, as shown below:

```julia
adjust_capacities_source!(allocation_model)
adjust_capacities_edge!(allocation_model)
adjust_capacities_basin!(allocation_model)
adjust_capacities_buffer!(allocation_model)
adjust_capacities_returnflow!(allocation_model, p)

for parameter in propertynames(p)
    demand_node = getfield(p, parameter)
    if demand_node isa AbstractDemandNode
        adjust_demands!(allocation_model, p, priority_idx, demand_node)
    end
end
```

## Output data
Function `save_demands_and_allocations` and `save_allocation_flows` save the allocated flow to corresponding nodes and edge in the subnetworks.

## Communicating to the physical layer
The function `assign_allocations` update subnetwork demand (`collect_demand`) or assign the allocated amount to user (`allocate`) with the result of the optimization.
Then it also writes the resulted flow to `Allocation` object.
