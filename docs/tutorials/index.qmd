The kernel of Ribasim is written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and is built on top of the [SciML: Open Source Software for Scientific Machine Learning](https://sciml.ai/) libraries, notably [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/).

The [Ribasim Python package](../guides/python.qmd) is available to build, update and analyze Ribasim models programmatically.
For runtime data exchange and coupling with other kernels, the Julia kernel is wrapped in a Python API (`ribasim_api`) which implements the Basic Modelling Interface [BMI](https://bmi-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The Ribasim QGIS plugin allows users to view or edit a model without programming.
For specific tasks, like adding long timeseries, using Python is strongly recommended.

One can also use Ribasim Python to build entire models from base data, such that your model setup is fully reproducible.

See [usage](../background/usage.qmd) for more information.
